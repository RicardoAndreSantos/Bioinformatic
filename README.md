# Bioinformatic
Work developed for bioinformatic course

### Assignment_1
Alignment of nucleotide (i.e., genes) or amino acid (i.e., proteins) pairs of sequences allows determining the similarity between two sequences.
Alignments between pairs of phylogenetically close sequences usually result in optimal complete alignments.
For the global alignment, it was used the algorithm developed by Needleman and Wunsch.
In the local alignments the algorithms developed by Smith and Waterman seek to maximize the best alignment between subsequences.

#### objectives:
* implementation of global and local alignment through dynamic programming;
* use of a REST web service to remotely test the algorithms developed (i.e., global and local alignment in gene and protein databases such as European Nucleotide Archived (ENA) and UniProt).
