## Implementation

The UPGMA algorithm is implemented in the file **Arvores_UPGMA.java**.

This file includes a menu that allows us to choose between inserting the filename with the associated sequence and matrix or inserting this data manually. </br>
Once the data is correctly entered, you can choose to view the tree generated by the UPGMA or check the ultrametric distances.

```
inserir_Folhas()
```
**inserir_Folhas** has a result list, in which each iteration is added discovered sequence at its level.

```
distancia_Ultrametrica();
```
**distancia_Ultrametrica** will calculate the success rate for nodes that fall below 30%.

## Execution

Compile : `javac Arvores_UPGMA.java` </br>
Run: `java Arvores_UPGMA`

In order to test these algorithm, some input files are available within the /examples folder.

If you want to use the example to construct the tree generated by the UPGMA, enter:
```
javac Arvores_UPGMA.java && java Arvores_UPGMA < input_1_alg.txt
```

If you want to check the ultrametric distances, enter:
```
javac Arvores_UPGMA.java && java Arvores_UPGMA < input_1_dist.txt
```
